# Nsfw extension for Semantic Kernel using NsfwSpy.Net

This extension is using [NsfwSpy.Net](https://nsfwspy.net) to detect NSFW content in images as they are generated by the Semantic Kernel.

The reason for this extension is that the Semantic Kernel is not able to detect NSFW content in images by itself and the use of creative phrasing can sometimes lead to NSFW content being generated by AI, so this acts as a safety net, or filter, to prevent NSFW content from being generated by accident.

Of course, this extension can also be used make sure that NSFW content is generated by the Semantic Kernel, if that is what you want, however, this can get expensive, as it will retry until it gets a result that is NSFW; but this might be desirable if you want to test existing safeguards.

## How to use

### Install

To install the extension, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet packages add Frank.SemanticKernel.Extensions.NsfwSpyDotNet
```
