# Thank you [BLaZeKiLL](https://github.com/BLaZeKiLL) for the inspiration!

[BLaZeKiLL](https://github.com/BLaZeKiLL) partook in the Semantic Kernel project's [Hackathon]() with a provider for Semantic Kernel that uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).

I stole some of his code and made this template, to make it easier to get started with Ollama and Semantic Kernel.
